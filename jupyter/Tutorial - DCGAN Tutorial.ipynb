    "GANs are a framework for teaching a DL model to capture the training data‚Äôs distribution so we can generate new data from that same distribution. GANs were invented by Ian Goodfellow in 2014 and first described in the paper Generative Adversarial Nets. They are made of two distinct models, a generator and a discriminator. The job of the generator is to spawn ‚Äòfake‚Äô images that look like the training images. The job of the discriminator is to look at an image and output whether or not it is a real training image or a fake image from the generator. During training, the generator is constantly trying to outsmart the discriminator by generating better and better fakes, while the discriminator is working to become a better detective and correctly classify the real and fake images. The equilibrium of this game is when the generator is generating perfect fakes that look as if they came directly from the training data, and the discriminator is left to always guess at 50% confidence that the generator output is real or fake.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, lets define some notation to be used throughout tutorial starting with the discriminator. Let $x$ be data representing an image. $D(x)$ is the discriminator network which outputs the (scalar) probability that $x$ came from training data rather than the generator. Here, since we are dealing with images the input to $D(x)$ is an image of HWC size 3x64x64. Intuitively, $D(x)$ should be HIGH when $x$ comes from training data and LOW when $x$ comes from the generator. $D(x)$ can also be thought of as a traditional binary classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the generator‚Äôs notation, let $z$ be a latent space vector sampled from a standard normal distribution. $G(z)$ represents the generator function which maps the latent vector $z$ to data-space. The goal of $G$ is to estimate the distribution that the training data comes from $(p_{data})$ so it can generate fake samples from that estimated distribution $(pg)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, $D(G(z))$ is the probability (scalar) that the output of the generator $G$ is a real image. As described in Goodfellow‚Äôs paper, $D$ and $G$ play a minimax game in which $D$ tries to maximize the probability it correctly classifies reals and fakes $(logD(x))$, and $G$ tries to minimize the probability that $D$ will predict its outputs are fake $(log(1‚àíD(G(x))))$. From the paper, the GAN loss function is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$minGmaxDV(D,G)=ùîºx‚àºpdata(x)[logD(x)]+ùîºz‚àºpz(z)[log(1‚àíD(G(z)))]$\n",
    "\n",
    "In theory, the solution to this minimax game is where pg=pdata, and the discriminator guesses randomly if the inputs are real or fake. However, the convergence theory of GANs is still being actively researched and in reality models do not always train to this point."

    "## What is a DCGAN?\n",
    "\n",
    "A DCGAN is a direct extension of the GAN described above, except that it explicitly uses convolutional and convolutional-transpose layers in the discriminator and generator, respectively. It was first described by Radford et. al. in the paper Unsupervised Representation Learning With Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks. The discriminator is made up of strided convolution layers, batch norm layers, and LeakyReLU activations. The input is a 3x64x64 input image and the output is a scalar probability that the input is from the real data distribution. The generator is comprised of convolutional-transpose layers, batch norm layers, and ReLU activations. The input is a latent vector, z, that is drawn from a standard normal distribution and the output is a 3x64x64 RGB image. The strided conv-transpose layers allow the latent vector to be transformed into a volume with the same shape as an image. In the paper, the authors also give some tips about how to setup the optimizers, how to calculate the loss functions, and how to initialize the model weights, all of which will be explained in the coming sections."

Since our data are images, converting $z$ to data-space means ultimately creating a RGB image with the same size as the training images (i.e. 3x64x64). In practice, this is accomplished through a series of strided two dimensional convolutional transpose layers, each paired with a 2d batch norm layer and a relu activation. The output of the generator is fed through a tanh function to return it to the input data range of [‚àí1,1]. It is worth noting the existence of the batch norm functions after the conv-transpose layers, as this is a critical contribution of the DCGAN paper. These layers help with the flow of gradients during training. An image of the generator from the DCGAN paper is shown below."
